## Ideas for design/inspiration
 I wanted have a very simplistic/ minimalistic design and have been drawn to Geometric designs.
 Straight lines, contrasting colours.

 For my design  was drawn towards Geometric designs and clean designs in modern office spaces. I had difficulty organising my ideas and putting enough on my site to show who I am but not enough to clutter the site and keep in minimal.

 ## Figma

 My figma design I spent alot of time attempting to make my logo. My idea was that I could desgin my logo and build my portfolio around the design of my logo. I think I spent too much time on the logo when designing the rest of my site would have sped things up quite alot.

## Fonts
I reviewed Google Fonts for idealy two font types to incorporate into my portfolio. Immediately I was drawn towards **Playfair Display**. I planned to use this font in my Logo design. 

I was in two minds regarding the direction I should take with my design. Even though I love simplistic, sharp, minimalistic designs as a person I am quite playful and silly. So I had a look at some more "adventurous" fonts. I tried playing around with **Indie Flower**, turns out, it looked like shit and did not suit my "playfull" side. So I desided it was my original idea that will work.

For my logo I decided that another font was required, somehting simple and sharp. So **Open Sans Condenced** it was.

Now for the font that would fill the body of my site. This one was a tricky one as I don't have an eye for this kind of thing. Long story short, **Roboto Condenced** it was.

So it turned out to be a bad idea, the combination of Open Sans Condenced and Roboto Condenced made my site look like a newspaper. It didn't look good. So in search of another font I went. 

In the end I ended up going with was **Montserrat**. It ended up looking the best with the rest of the site.

 ## Colour scheme
 https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/

 I used canva for examples of colour pallets and started experimenting with how the colours would work with a simple logo design.

 The two colour pallatte schemes that I was drawn too were "Industrial & in Control" and "Classic Metallics". 

 Both incoropated four colours, each with a type of black, a metal, a white and another colour cut through.

### Logo Design
The Logo I wanted to incorportate a Geometric design that I could make myself and that would be used in the background with two or three other geometric designs that I design. I had several ideas regarding the shapes to be used as part of the desgin and how they could be used in multiple situations across the website.
I initially started with my initials within a block design, black background sans serrif font/ white text. unfortunatelty ocne made, it was not easy to incorporate into multiple sitiuations.

I redesigned the logo with a circular

## What Went Well

- The initial logo phase went well and felt very productive.
- The colour pallette that i decided to use I was happy with.
- The layout of the Home page with the Logo design works well.
- Portfolio wheel of fortune.

## What Was Challenging

### Using CSS Grid
  During the inital stage of coding I was using CSS Grid for the layout. After a day and a half of pulling my hair out I decided to get some guidance from Reugan. 

  He brought it to my attention that CSS Grid was a bad idea for the type of design that I was going for. So I had to go through and change everything over to FlexBox.

  Everything worked instantly! I wish. It took a bit of time to go through and learn Flexbox and it continued to give me problems right up to when I had to push the site to GitHub.

  ### Menu
  I wanted to have a menu that would remain hidden when not used and then slide out when clicked. Unfortunately most of the Youtube tutorials that I followed and attempted to replicate (even though the said it didn't include) involved JQuery (which wasn't allowed to be included).
  I ended up putting a menu in the nav bar of each page as I didn't want it to affect the look of the home page.


  ## What Got Changed

  ### Portfolio/Tech Stack
  I had initially designed the page to have a seperate Tech Stack and Portfolio pages. Unfortunately the design didn't look right, there just wasn't enough skills to fill out an entire page (even on mobile).

  So I decided to bring both pages together. This filled out the screen better than both had initialy.

  Also the portfolio is ended up putting into a css wheel that turns and opens when the user hovers over the element.

## Where to from here

-  Changing the menu to a hidden menu
-  Making the site responsive, not happy with the look on desktop
-  Adding more Geometric designs to the site.
